Instead of adding all props to the component (f.ex const Author =(props)=>{}), the guy added specified props (f.ex const Author =({title, books})=>{})....to me passing just props is more convenient
Example here: https://codesandbox.io/s/authorquiz-z39pz?file=/src/AuthorQuiz.js

**Today's Progress**: I learned about working with CSS Modules in React. CSS Modules allows to automatically create a unique classname without worrying about naming clashes. You can also compose a new class by inheriting styles from other classes, declare global classes or use multiple classes. Very powerful concept.

##### React, #CSS, #HTML
**Today's Progress**: Was working under Test Report projects today. When I had 30 min break from react, i did @FronetendMentor challenge - Huddle landing page with a single introductory section.

**Today's Progress**: Was working under Test Report projects. Spend tons of time implementing check box group component. Didndt expect that it would be so difficult :/ But here it is:

### R2_Day 16: July 3, 2020
##### React
**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about how to debug React apps. You can find logical errors  using dev tools, you can istall Chrome extention and work with React Developer Tools, or you can use Error Boundaries component if you have React version 16+. This component catches errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.

### R2_Day 17: July 4, 2020
##### React
**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about Component Lifecycle. Lifecycle available only in class-based components and upon its creation such methods are called:
-constructor (to initialize state only)
- getDerivedStateFromProps (props, state) - to sync state if props were changed
- render() - to render JSX to the DOM
- child components render
- componentDidMount() - here you can use side-effects 

### R2_Day 18: July 6, 2020
##### React
**Today's Progress**: Today I continued topic about Components Lifecycle and learned about update lifecycle for props and state in class-based component.
For functional component a useEffect() hook should be used. Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. So, useEffect() hook is used for performing any side-effects. 

### R2_Day 19: July 7, 2020
##### React
**Today's Progress**: Today i was learning about optimization of React app with diff approaches:
- using function ShouldComponentUpdate (for class-based components)
- using PureComponent(for class-based)
- using React.memo(for functional components)

### R2_Day 20: July 8, 2020
##### React
**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about High Order Components (HOC) - an advanced element for reusing logic in React components. HOC take one or more components as arguments, and return a new upgraded component:
const HighOrderComponent = (WrappedComponent, className)=>{
    return props => (
        <div className = {className}>
            <WrappedComponent {...props}/>
        </div> )}

### R2_Day 21: July 10, 2020
##### React
**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about Context API - a JavaScript object which can be passed between React components without using props.
It helps with props drilling, very useful in large applications with many components and props passing through. You use Context.Provider on the parent component and Context.Consumer on the child component.

### R2_Day 22: July 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Today I spent time on my portfolio. I took a course on preparation for job hunt and it appeared that there are many things you should consider before you apply for job. There is even a research you should do to be able to use certain words in CV

### R2_Day 23: July 13, 2020
##### React
**Today's Progress:** Since my kids are back to summer activities, I have time to work under Test Report. Still cannot figure out though how to implement filter based on checkbox selected :((( makes me sad

### R2_Day 24: July 15, 2020
##### React
**Today's Progress:** I have been refactoring code for Test Report. IMPORTANT! to self - dont forget to commit changes often, so you can roll it all back if your code stops to work after shitty refactoring ;)

### R2_Day 25: July 17, 2020
##### React
**Today's Progress:**  Was busy transferring Test Report project from create-React-app to plain HTML page (per client request). To do that you need: 
- add 3 scripts to head section: React, React-dom and Babel
- add div with id=root to body
- add script with type=text/babel right after div in body and paste there all JS code
- add ReactDOM.render() with special params to end of babel script
You also need to adjust all your hooks or icons - everything you imported to project before needs to be adjusted

### R2_Day 26: July 20, 2020
##### React
**Today's Progress:**  Reading took the most of my time today. I found few interesting articles about React Tips & Tricks and i did learn a few from them. 
I discovered that you can use React.Fragment as a root element as a template (it replaces div or empty tag in return method):
const Login = () =>
  <React.Fragment><input name="login"/><input name="password"/></React.Fragment>;

**Today's Progress:** Finally I managed to implement test Report filter feature - took me a while....Project is ready now to be introduced to a customer, may be some debugging still be needed. Next week I'll tell you how it went and what was the feedback :)
Now I need to find something new to work on.
