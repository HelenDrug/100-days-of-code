### Day 4: March 2, 2020
##### Continue to work on Survey Form for FCC assigment

**Today's Progress**: Finished writing HTML for the page - completed checkboxes and teaxtarea elements, created Submit button.
**Thoughts:** Had difficulty to understand Value attribute for radio buttons and checkboxes, still not sure how often and where it is used? In which cases you really need to change the Value attribute as it is never seen by the client side? Probably this understanding will come later with practice :)
