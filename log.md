### Day 62: April 30, 2020
##### React
**Today's Progress**: Today I watched video tutorial on #Pluralsight about building quizz with React components. It had different approach of adding props. Instead of adding all props to the component (f.ex const Author =(props)=>{}), the guy added specified props (f.ex const Author =({title, books})=>{})....to me passing just props is more convenient
